# React and Express.js Device Shop

#### **A portfolio project showcasing various e-commerce features and integrations.**
A full-stack e-commerce application built with **React** (frontend) and **Node.js + Express.js** (backend), using **PostgreSQL** for data storage and **Stripe** for payment processing.

While not all features are fully polished, the project provides the core functionality needed for online selling: 
- product listings,
- administration panel with full control over users, products, orders, and static content.
- user profile with full account management: orders, addresses, personal info, and more.
- payments processed via Stripe, including full order lifecycle handling.

The project is deployed on **GitHub Pages** (frontend) and **Heroku** (backend). Images are stored externally (ImageDB / ImageKit).

It also includes **powerful fuzzy search** (handles misspelled queries). Item search and FAQ search are implemented with slightly different approaches.

Additionally, a **configurable eBay item parser** has been implemented with rate limiting and adaptive parsing.
#### **Coded just for fun to experiment with different features and libraries.**
