# React and Express.js Device Shop

#### **This is not a commercial project, but a fully functional one.**
A simple e-commerce shop built with **React** (frontend) and **Node.js + Express.js** (backend). Data is stored in a **PostgreSQL database**.

While not all features are fully polished, the project provides the core functionality needed for online selling: 
- product listings,
- administration panel with full control over users, goods, orders, and static content, etc.

The project is deployed on **GitHub Pages** (frontend) and **Heroku** (backend). Images are stored externally (ImageDB / ImageKit).

It also includes **powerful fuzzy search** (handles misspelled queries). Item search and FAQ search are implemented with slightly different approaches.

Additionally, a **configurable eBay item parser** has been implemented. It is designed to be clever enough to bypass eBayâ€™s anti-scraping mechanisms and avoid blocking during item parsing.
#### **Coded just for fun to experiment with different features and libraries.**
